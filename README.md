Yelp User Business Rating Prediction Contest

This project refers to the programs that I wrote for the Kaggle YelpRecSys Contest.
The contest was to predict what rating a user will give to a business in scale of 1 - 5.
From the initial time, the test set had a large proportion of cold start data.
This prompted to go for a hybrid model. Collbarative Filtering + Content Based Filtering.
